### `npm start`

Runs app in development mode.
App runs on port 3000.

### Current Issue

CSS & JSX changes save and browser successfully hot reloads. Now, I am searching for a way to have external css files (via mini-css-extract-plugin) update with auto browser refreshes so that when javascript is blocked on the browser, all saved changes are still applied.
